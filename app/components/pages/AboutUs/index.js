                We treat patients as unique individuals. We believe that the best medical care can only be delivered in
                a setting where the physician knows their patients. Patients are cared for only by our small group, and
                Dr. Christi Menges is one of few Obstetrician/Gynecologists who provides personalized care to all her patients.
                We provide a full spectrum of womenâ€™s health services; including routine and problem gynecological care,
                routine and high risk prenatal care, minimal invasive surgery, major surgery, permanent sterilization,
                and menopausal health.
                Our office believes that emergencies cannot wait months for appointments, and we guarantee same day
                services for all emergency cases. We offer morning, afternoon, evening and weekend office hours. When
                our doctors are not in the office, one is always available to answer emergency questions.
                Our office is a state of the art facility where every effort is made to provide you with the attentive
                care and comfort you deserve and expect from your doctor. It is conveniently located at Clarkson and
                Baxter in Chesterfield and has its own entrance and parking.
